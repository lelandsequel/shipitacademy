## Code of Conduct

- **Build, don't theorize.** This is a build environment. Discussions are welcome when they unblock work. Extended debates about architecture philosophy are not.
- **Help others.** If you're ahead, help someone who's behind. The cohort ships together.
- **Respect the pace.** Modules are timed. Start on time, end on time, produce the artifact.
- **Keep it professional.** Treat other participants, the facilitator, and support staff with respect.
- **No recording without consent.** Do not record other participants without their explicit permission.
- **Confidentiality.** What others build is their work. Do not share other participants' projects, code, or business ideas without their permission.

## Cancellation

- Cancel more than 7 days before the weekend: full refund
- Cancel 3-7 days before: 50% refund or transfer to next cohort
- Cancel less than 3 days before or no-show: no refund
