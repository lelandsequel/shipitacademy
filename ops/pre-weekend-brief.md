## What to Bring

- Laptop (charged, charger packed)
- Setup checklist completed (if it's not done by now, finish it tonight)
- API keys configured and tested
- Headphones
- Notebook or scratch paper for architecture diagrams
- Water bottle

**Leverage Systems track only:** Bring real work files/data you want to run through your pipeline. Not hypothetical data — actual work product.

---

## What NOT to Bring

- Slide decks
- Presentations about what you "plan to build someday"
- Expectations of lectures or keynotes

This is a build weekend. You will be writing code, running pipelines, and shipping artifacts from 9:00 AM Saturday until 5:00 PM Sunday.

## Mindset

**Come ready to ship imperfect work.** The goal is not a polished product. The goal is a working system that proves your concept. You can refine it after the weekend. You cannot refine something that doesn't exist.

**Ask for help within 15 minutes of getting stuck.** The facilitator and support team are there to unblock you. Every minute you spend silently stuck is a minute wasted.

**Commit early and often.** Save your progress. Push your code. If your laptop dies, your work should be recoverable.
