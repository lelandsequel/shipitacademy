**Facilitator:** TJ Jourdan

## What You're Building

**Ship Systems track:** You will build and deploy a working AI system in 48 hours. You'll leave with a defined, designed, built, tested, and deployed system — live URL, demo video, full documentation.

**Leverage Systems track:** You will build an operator leverage package. You'll leave with a working AI pipeline, a professional value asset, positioning, proof of results, and one real outreach message sent.

This is not a lecture series. There are no slides. Every module produces an artifact. You ship before Sunday is over.

## Before the Weekend

Complete the setup checklist (attached). Everything on it needs to be done before Saturday morning. If you show up without your environment configured, you'll spend the first two hours debugging instead of building.

The checklist includes:
- Development environment setup
- API keys and accounts
- Repository access
- Communication channel (Discord)

**Deadline:** Complete setup by Thursday evening before the weekend.

## What to Expect

- Saturday: define, design, scaffold, build
- Sunday: evaluate, deploy, demo (Ship Systems) / prove, position, outreach (Leverage Systems)
- Pace is fast. Modules are timed. You will feel behind at some point — that's normal. Ask for help early.
- Facilitator and support are there to unblock you, not to lecture you.

## One Rule

Ship over polish. Working beats elegant. Done beats perfect.

See you Saturday.
