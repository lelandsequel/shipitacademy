Welcome to Ship Weekend.

You now have access to Ship OS — your structured build kit for shipping a real AI system in 48 hours.

**What you got:** Ship OS (curriculum + prompts + tools)
**Next Ship Weekend:** March 7–8, 2026
**Format:** Self-directed. Async. At your pace.

## What Is Ship OS

Ship OS is a 9-module build system. It contains everything you need to go from idea to deployed: the full curriculum, step-by-step execution prompts, architecture templates, eval checklists, and deployment guides.

Ship Weekend is not a course. There is no instructor. No live sessions. No schedule. Just you, the system, and 48 hours.

## Your Two Tracks

**Ship Systems (Track A):** Build and deploy a working AI system — defined, designed, built, tested, deployed, and demoed.

**Leverage Systems (Track B):** Build an operator leverage package — working AI pipeline, professional value asset, positioning, proof, and real outreach sent.

Pick one. Ship OS guides you through either.

## How to Access Ship OS

Your Ship OS build kit is linked below. Open it and start with Module 01: Orient.

**Setup:** Make sure your development environment is ready before you start building. Ship OS includes a setup checklist — complete it first so you can build without interruption.

## Community (Optional)

Join the Discord to share what you're building, post your demo, or work alongside other builders. This is entirely optional — Ship Weekend works fully solo.

## One Rule

Ship over polish. Working beats elegant. Done beats perfect.

See you on the other side.
