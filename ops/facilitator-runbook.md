# Facilitator Runbook

## For: Charles Jourdan
## Program: Operator Foundry Weekend Intensive

## Your Role

You are the public face of the weekend. Participants see you as the instructor and guide. Your job is to:

1. **Frame each module** — set the objective, state what the artifact is, set the timer
2. **Unblock participants** — circulate during build blocks, catch people who are stuck
3. **Maintain pace** — the schedule is tight. Do not let modules run over.
4. **Review artifacts** — check quality at each checkpoint. Push back on weak work.
5. **Handle the room** — energy, focus, questions, frustrations

You are not lecturing. You are facilitating execution.

## Weekend Rhythm

### Module Structure (every module follows this pattern)
1. **Frame** (5-10 min) — state the objective, show the artifact template, set expectations
2. **Build block** (40-70 min) — participants work. You circulate.
3. **Review/checkpoint** (10-20 min) — participants show work, get feedback, commit

### Energy Arc
- **Saturday morning:** high energy, fresh. Use it for definition and design work.
- **Saturday afternoon:** energy dips after lunch. This is the deep build block — minimize transitions, maximize uninterrupted work time.
- **Sunday morning:** renewed energy but time pressure. Module pacing is critical.
- **Sunday afternoon:** fatigue + urgency. Keep instructions tight. Celebrate progress.

## Pacing Guide

### If a module is running long:
- Cut the review short, not the build time
- Move the review to the beginning of the next module
- Never cut build time — that's where the work happens

### If a participant is ahead of schedule:
- Point them to stretch goals in the module
- Ask them to help someone who's behind
- Let them start the next module early

### If a participant is behind:
- Check: are they stuck on a technical issue or a scope issue?
- Technical: help them debug or pair them with someone
- Scope: help them cut features. "What's the minimum version?"
- If critically behind by Sunday morning: help them define a reduced scope that still produces a shippable artifact

## Handling Common Situations

### Participant is stuck and not asking for help
Walk up. Ask: "Where are you?" Listen. Then: "What's blocking you?" Solve it or pair them.

### Participant is over-engineering
> "That's a week-two feature. What's the minimum that works for the demo?"

### Participant's system doesn't work by end of Saturday
This is not a crisis. Note what's broken. First thing Sunday: fix it before Module 06. Allocate 30 min of Sunday morning buffer.

### Participant wants to switch their project mid-weekend
Only allow this if they're less than 2 hours in on Saturday. After Module 03, they commit to what they have.

### Participant is frustrated
Acknowledge it. "This is hard. That's the point. Let's figure out what's blocking you." Don't motivational-speak. Solve the problem.

### Technical infrastructure issue (WiFi, API outage, etc.)
Have a hotspot ready. Know the free-tier limits of each API provider. Have backup API keys for emergencies.

## Artifact Review Standards

At each checkpoint, check:

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Artifact exists | File committed to repo | "I'll do it later" |
| Artifact is specific | Contains concrete details | Vague, generic, placeholder text |
| Artifact matches the template | All sections filled | Missing sections |
| Artifact is honest | Reflects actual work and decisions | Aspirational fiction |

If an artifact fails, the participant revises before moving on. Do not let participants accumulate incomplete artifacts.
