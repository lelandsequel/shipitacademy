# Module 07: Positioning

## Leverage Systems Weekend — Sunday, 10:30 AM

---

## Objective
Write your positioning: what you now offer, who it's for, and why it's different. Your leverage system changes what you can deliver — this module makes that change explicit and communicable.

## Duration
90 minutes

---

## Facilitator Guide

### Frame (10 min)
> "You built a system. You produced a value asset. Now you need to articulate what changed. Positioning isn't marketing — it's clarity. When someone asks 'what do you do?', your answer should be different after this weekend than it was before."

### The Positioning Framework
Four components:
1. **What you offer** — the service, capability, or deliverable (not the AI system — the outcome it enables)
2. **Who it's for** — specific audience, not "everyone"
3. **Why it's different** — what you can now do that others can't (speed, quality, depth, scale)
4. **Proof** — evidence that it works (you'll build this in Module 08)

### Build Block (60 min)

**Step 1: Positioning Statement (20 min)**
Write one paragraph:
> "I help [specific audience] [achieve specific outcome] by [method/approach]. Unlike [alternative], I [key differentiator] because [reason/capability]."

Facilitator pushes on:
- **Generic audience**: "businesses" is not an audience. "B2B SaaS companies with 10-50 employees who need weekly content" is.
- **Vague differentiator**: "I use AI" is not different. Everyone uses AI. "I deliver a complete competitive analysis in 2 hours instead of 2 weeks" is different.
- **Feature-focus**: Don't describe your tools. Describe the outcome your client gets.

**Step 2: Offer Description (20 min)**
Expand the positioning into a concrete offer:
- What the client gets (deliverables)
- How it's delivered (format, timeline)
- What the client does vs. what you do
- Price anchor (what this would cost from a traditional provider)

**Step 3: One-Liner (20 min)**
Compress everything into a single sentence you can say in conversation:
> "[Outcome] for [audience] in [timeframe]."

Examples:
- "Complete competitor intelligence reports for SaaS founders in 48 hours."
- "Full content calendars with drafted posts for e-commerce brands, weekly."
- "Technical due diligence summaries for VC partners in 24 hours."

### Review (20 min)
Each participant reads their one-liner and positioning statement.
- Room votes: is the audience clear? Is the differentiator real? Would you buy this?
