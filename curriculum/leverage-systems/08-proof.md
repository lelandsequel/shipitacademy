# Module 08: Proof

## Leverage Systems Weekend — Sunday, 1:00 PM

---

## Objective
Capture proof that your leverage system works: before/after comparison, time saved, and output quality assessment. Proof is what makes your positioning credible and your outreach effective.

## Duration
90 minutes

## Facilitator Guide

### Frame (10 min)
> "Anyone can claim they work faster with AI. Proof is what separates a claim from a capability. This module produces the evidence that your leverage system delivers real results."

### Three Types of Proof

1. **Before/After** — Same task, done manually vs. done with your system. Side-by-side comparison.
2. **Time Proof** — Measured time to complete a task with your system vs. estimated manual time.
3. **Quality Proof** — Output quality comparison: is the AI-assisted output as good or better?

You need all three. Not one. All three.

### Build Block (70 min)

**Step 1: Before/After Comparison (25 min)**
Select one task you've done manually before. Produce the output both ways:
- **Before**: the manual output (use a past example from your actual work)
- **After**: run the same task through your leverage system

Document side-by-side:
- What does the manual version look like?
- What does the system version look like?
- What's the same? What's different? What's better? What's worse?

**Step 2: Time Measurement (20 min)**
Run your pipeline with a new input. Time it precisely:
- Time from input to output (system): ___ minutes
- Estimated time for manual equivalent: ___ hours
- Leverage ratio: ___x

Be honest. If the system takes 20 minutes of human setup + 5 minutes of processing, the real time is 25 minutes, not 5.

**Step 3: Quality Assessment (25 min)**
Evaluate the system output against professional standards:
- Would a client accept this as-is?
- What human review/editing is needed?
- Rate output quality: 1-10 compared to manual output
- Identify quality gaps and note what would fix them

### Review (10 min)
Each participant presents their proof:
- Before/after side-by-side
- Time comparison
- Quality rating

Facilitator challenge: "Would a skeptical prospect believe this proof?"

| Total time | ___ hrs | ___ min | ___x |
| Human time (active) | ___ hrs | ___ min | ___x |
| Wait/processing time | N/A | ___ min | — |

### Quality Assessment

| Dimension | Manual (1-10) | System (1-10) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Accuracy | | | |

### Proof Summary
_Two sentences summarizing your leverage proof:_
> "My system produces [output] in [time] compared to [manual time] — a [X]x improvement. Output quality is [assessment], with [minimal/some/significant] human review needed."
