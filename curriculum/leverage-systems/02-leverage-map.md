# Module 02: Leverage Map

## Leverage Systems Weekend — Saturday, 9:45 AM

---

## Objective
Map your current workflow: where your time goes, which tasks are high-skill but repetitive, and where AI can multiply your output. This is diagnostic work — you need to see the system before you can improve it.

## Duration
75 minutes

---

## Facilitator Guide

### Frame (10 min)
> "You can't build leverage if you don't know where you're spending time. This module is about mapping your actual workflow — not what you wish it looked like, but what it actually looks like. Be honest. The leverage is hiding in the work you do every week that you barely think about."

Three categories of work:
1. **High-skill, high-repetition** — You do this well, you do it often, and it takes real time. This is where AI leverage is highest.
2. **High-skill, low-repetition** — Important but rare. Less leverage here for now.
3. **Low-skill, high-repetition** — Automate this with basic tools. AI is overkill.

The target: category 1. High-skill work you do repeatedly.

### Build Block (45 min)

**Step 1: Time Audit (15 min)**
Participants list every work task they did in the last week. Estimate hours for each. Categories:
- Client/customer work
- Internal operations
- Communication (email, calls, messages)
- Research and analysis
- Content creation
- Admin and logistics

**Step 2: Skill-Repetition Matrix (15 min)**
Plot each task on the matrix:

```
HIGH SKILL
    |
    |  [Leverage Zone]     [Strategic Work]
    |  High-skill,         High-skill,
    |  repetitive          unique
    |
    |------------------------
    |
    |  [Automate]          [Delegate/Eliminate]
    |  Low-skill,          Low-skill,
    |  repetitive          unique
    |
LOW SKILL
         HIGH REPETITION ---------> LOW REPETITION
```

**Step 3: AI Opportunity Identification (15 min)**
For each task in the Leverage Zone, answer:
- What is the input? (What do you start with?)
- What is the output? (What do you produce?)
- What's the transformation? (What skill do you apply?)
- Could AI perform or assist with that transformation?
- What would 10x look like? (10x speed, 10x volume, 10x quality)

### Review (20 min)
Each participant presents:
- Their top 3 leverage zone tasks
- Which one they think has the highest AI leverage potential
- What "10x" would look like for that task

Facilitator: challenge weak leverage claims. "That saves you 5 minutes a week" is not leverage. "That lets you serve 10 clients instead of 2" is leverage.
