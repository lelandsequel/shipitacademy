# Module 06: Value Asset

## Leverage Systems Weekend — Sunday, 9:00 AM

---

## Objective
Create a value asset — a document, template, or tool that captures your leverage and is deliverable to a client or stakeholder. This is the tangible output of your leverage system. Something you can send, sell, or use as proof of capability.

## Duration
90 minutes

## Facilitator Guide

### Frame (10 min)
> "Yesterday you built a pipeline. Today you turn it into something a client or stakeholder can hold. A value asset is the artifact your leverage system produces — not the system itself, but its output, packaged professionally."

### Types of Value Assets

| Type | Example | Best When |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Document** | Analysis report, strategy brief, audit summary | Your system produces written analysis |
| **Template** | Reusable framework, checklist, scorecard | Your system produces structured output others can reuse |
| **Tool** | Calculator, generator, dashboard | Your system produces interactive output |
| **Package** | Multiple outputs bundled (report + data + recommendations) | Your system produces a comprehensive deliverable |

### Build Block (70 min)

**Step 1: Define the Asset (15 min)**
Answer:
- What is the deliverable? (Not the pipeline — the thing the pipeline produces)
- Who receives it? (Client, stakeholder, team member)
- What format? (PDF, spreadsheet, web page, Notion doc)
- What makes it professional-grade? (Design, structure, completeness)

**Step 2: Build the Asset (40 min)**
Run your pipeline with real data and shape the output into a deliverable:
- Add structure (sections, headers, flow)
- Add context (why this analysis matters, what the recipient should do with it)
- Add presentation quality (formatting, layout, visual clarity)
- Remove artifacts of the AI process (no "As an AI..." preamble, no prompt leakage)

**Step 3: Quality Check (15 min)**
Would you send this to a paying client right now?
- Is it complete?
- Is it accurate?
- Is it professional?
- Does it demonstrate the leverage your system provides?
- If no to any of these: fix it.

### Review (10 min)
Each participant shows their value asset. Facilitator evaluates:
- Does it look like something a professional produced?
- Could you sell this?
- Does it clearly demonstrate the leverage?
