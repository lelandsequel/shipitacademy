# Module 09: Outreach

## Leverage Systems Weekend — Sunday, 3:00 PM

---

## Objective
Write one outreach message to one real prospect using your new leverage positioning and proof. Not a template. Not a draft. A real message to a real person that you send before leaving this room.

## Duration
90 minutes

## Facilitator Guide

### Frame (10 min)
> "You built a system. You have proof it works. You have positioning. Now you use it. One message. One real prospect. Before you leave today."

This is not a marketing exercise. This is a single, personalized message to someone who could benefit from what you now offer.

### Outreach Principles
1. **Specific, not generic.** Name the person. Reference their work. Show you know their problem.
2. **Value first, pitch second.** Lead with insight or a sample of what you can do, not with "I'd love to chat."
3. **Proof included.** Reference or attach your proof — before/after, time savings, sample output.
4. **Clear ask.** One specific next step. Not "let me know your thoughts." Something like: "Can I send you a sample analysis of your [specific thing] this week?"
5. **Short.** Under 150 words. Busy people don't read long messages.

### Build Block (50 min)

**Step 1: Select the Prospect (10 min)**
Participants identify one real person:
- Someone they know or have a connection to
- Someone whose problem matches their positioning
- Someone who would recognize the value of what they built

Not a cold lead. Not a CEO you've never met. Someone you can reach and who would read your message.

**Step 2: Research (10 min)**
Spend 10 minutes learning about the prospect:
- What are they working on right now?
- What problem do they likely have that your system solves?
- What language do they use to describe their work?

**Step 3: Write the Message (20 min)**
Use the template as a starting point, then customize:
- Open with a specific reference to their work
- State the value you can provide
- Include proof (metric, sample, or before/after)
- Make a clear, specific ask
- Keep it under 150 words

**Step 4: Send (10 min)**
Review your message one final time. Then send it. Email, LinkedIn, DM — whatever channel you have access to.

> "If you're hesitating, that's normal. Send it anyway. The worst outcome is no response. The best outcome is a client."

### Debrief (30 min)
Each participant reads their message to the room (prospect name optional).
- Facilitator feedback: is the value clear? Is the proof compelling? Is the ask specific?
- Group discussion: what felt hard about this? What would you change?
- Reminder: follow up in 3-5 days if no response. One follow-up, not ten.

## Artifact
Each participant: one real outreach message sent to one real prospect.

## Weekend Complete
You walked in as someone who uses AI. You're walking out as an operator — with a working leverage system, a value asset, positioning, proof, and your first outreach sent. That's leverage.
