# Module 03: Opportunity Thesis

## Leverage Systems Weekend — Saturday, 11:00 AM

---

## Objective
Take your highest-leverage opportunity from the leverage map and write a one-page thesis: what the opportunity is, why AI makes it viable now, what the system looks like, and what the outcome is worth.

## Duration
90 minutes (including lunch overlap)

---

## Facilitator Guide

### Frame (10 min)
> "You've identified where your leverage is. Now you make the case for building it. A thesis is not a business plan — it's a one-page argument for why this system is worth building and what changes when it exists."

The thesis answers four questions:
1. **What is the opportunity?** — What high-skill, repetitive work can be systematized with AI?
2. **Why now?** — What about current AI capabilities makes this possible today that wasn't possible 12 months ago?
3. **What does the system look like?** — Inputs, outputs, AI role, human role
4. **What is the outcome worth?** — Time saved, capacity gained, revenue enabled, quality improved

### Build Block (60 min)

Participants write the thesis using the template. Facilitator circulates and pushes on:

- **Weak "why now"**: "AI is getting better" is not a thesis. Specific capabilities matter: "GPT-4-class models can now reliably extract structured data from unstructured legal documents with 95%+ accuracy" is a thesis.
- **Vague outcomes**: "It saves time" is not enough. How much time? For how many tasks? What does that enable? "It reduces proposal writing from 4 hours to 20 minutes, which means I can respond to 12x more RFPs per month."
- **Scope creep**: The thesis is about one opportunity. Not three. Not a platform. One leverage application.

### Peer Review (20 min)
Pair participants. Each person reads their thesis to their partner. Partner evaluates:
- Could you explain this opportunity to someone else in 30 seconds?
- Is the "why now" convincing?
- Is the outcome quantified?
- Is the scope realistic for this weekend?

## Participant Template

### Opportunity Thesis

**Title:** ___

**The Opportunity**
_One paragraph. What high-skill, repetitive work are you systematizing? Who does this work today? What does the current process look like?_

**Why Now**
_One paragraph. What specific AI capability makes this viable today? What changed in the last 12 months? Why couldn't you build this before?_

**The System**
_One paragraph. Describe the system at a high level:_
- Input: what goes in (format, source, frequency)
- AI role: what the AI does (specific tasks, not "helps with")
- Human role: what the human still does (review, approve, customize)
- Output: what comes out (format, quality, speed)

**The Outcome**
_One paragraph. Quantify the leverage:_
- Current state: ___ hours per [task/week/client] to produce [output]
- Future state: ___ minutes per [task/week/client] to produce [same output]
- Leverage ratio: ___x
- What this enables: ___ (more clients, higher quality, new capability, new revenue)

**Weekend Scope**
_What specifically will you build this weekend to prove this thesis? Be ruthlessly specific._

## Thesis Quality Checklist
- [ ] Opportunity is specific (one task, not "everything")
- [ ] "Why now" references specific AI capabilities
- [ ] System description includes concrete inputs and outputs
- [ ] Outcome is quantified (numbers, not adjectives)
- [ ] Weekend scope is realistic and clearly defined
