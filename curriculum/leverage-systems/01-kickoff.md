# Module 01: Kickoff

## Leverage Systems Weekend — Saturday, 9:00 AM

---

## Facilitator Guide

### Objective
Frame the leverage model. Introduce operator thinking. Every participant leaves Sunday with a complete leverage package — not theory, not a plan, a working system with proof and positioning.

### Setup (before participants arrive)
- Room: power strips, projector, Wi-Fi credentials posted
- Confirm each participant has access to their tools, accounts, and workspace
- Print setup checklist as backup

### Opening (15 min)
1. State the mission:
   > "You are here to build an operator leverage package. By Sunday evening, you'll have a working system that multiplies your output, proof that it works, positioning that explains what you now offer, and one real outreach message sent to a real prospect."
2. Introduce yourself. Credentials only.
3. Define "operator" for this weekend:
   > "An operator is someone who uses AI systems to multiply their output — not as a novelty, but as infrastructure. You don't just use AI. You build leverage with it."

### Operator vs. User (10 min)
Draw the distinction:
- **User**: asks AI a question, gets an answer, does the work manually
- **Operator**: builds a system that takes input, processes it through AI, and produces output at scale
- **Leverage**: the ratio between effort invested and output produced. Operators build systems where that ratio compounds.

### Participant Introductions (20 min)
Each participant: 60 seconds max.
- Name
- What you do (role, industry, clients)
- Where you spend the most time on repetitive, high-skill work
- What "10x output" would look like for you

Facilitator: take notes. These introductions reveal the leverage opportunities.

### Transition
> "Module 02 starts in 5 minutes. You're going to map exactly where your time goes and identify where AI can multiply your output."

## Participant Handout

### What You're Doing This Weekend
You are building an operator leverage package. By Sunday evening, you will have:
- A leverage map showing where AI multiplies your output
- An opportunity thesis for your highest-leverage application
- A working AI-powered workflow
- A value asset (doc, template, or tool) that captures your leverage
- Positioning that explains what you offer and why it's different
- Proof: before/after comparison showing the leverage
- One real outreach message sent to one real prospect

### Weekend Schedule

**Saturday**
| Time | Module | Output |

| 9:00 | Kickoff | Operator mindset set |
| 9:45 | Leverage Map | Map of current workflow + AI opportunity zones |
| 11:00 | Opportunity Thesis | One-page thesis on highest-leverage opportunity |
| 1:00 | AI Stack | Designed AI stack: models, tools, orchestration |
| 2:30 | Workflow | Working automated pipeline |

**Sunday**
| Time | Module | Output |
|------|--------|--------|

3. Use your actual workflow, not a made-up example
4. Ask for help early
