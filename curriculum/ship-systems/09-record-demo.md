# Module 09: Record Demo

## Ship Systems Weekend — Sunday, 3:00 PM

---

## Objective
Record a 2-minute demo video of your system. Show what it does, how it works, and what you would build next. This is your proof of work.

## Duration
90 minutes (recording + review)

---

## Facilitator Guide

### Frame (10 min)
> "You built a system. You shipped it. Now you document it. A 2-minute demo is worth more than a 20-page doc. It's proof you can build, and it's a portfolio piece you can send to anyone."

### Demo Structure (strict 2-minute format)

| Segment | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| What it does | 20 sec | One sentence: what the system does and who it's for |
| Live demo | 60 sec | Screen recording: real input, real output, live system |
| How it works | 20 sec | Quick architecture: "it uses X model, Y tools, deployed on Z" |
| What's next | 20 sec | One or two things you'd build next with more time |

### Recording Guidelines
- Screen recording with voiceover (no face cam required, but allowed)
- Tools: Loom, QuickTime, OBS, or any screen recorder
- Resolution: 1080p minimum
- Audio: clear voice, no background noise. Use headset mic if available.
- No editing required — one take is fine if it's clean

### Build Block (50 min)

**Step 1: Script (10 min)**
Write out what you'll say in each segment. Not a word-for-word script — bullet points.

**Step 2: Dry Run (10 min)**
Run through the demo once without recording. Time it. If it's over 2:30, cut content.

**Step 3: Record (15 min)**
Record the demo. You get 2-3 takes max. Pick the best one.

**Step 4: Upload (15 min)**
Upload to: YouTube (unlisted), Loom, Google Drive, or any shareable link.
Add the link to your project README.

### Demo Reviews (30 min)
Each participant plays their demo for the room.
- Facilitator feedback: was the problem clear? Was the demo compelling? Was the "what's next" realistic?
- Peer feedback: one piece of positive feedback, one suggestion

## Participant Template

### Demo Script

**What it does (20 sec):**
> "[System name] is a [type of system] that [what it does] for [who it's for]. You give it [input] and it [produces output]."

**Live demo (60 sec):**
1. Open the deployed URL / run the CLI command
2. Provide [specific input]
3. Show the system processing
4. Show the output
5. Point out one thing that's particularly effective

**How it works (20 sec):**
> "Under the hood, it uses [model/API] for [task], [tool] for [task], and is deployed on [platform]."

**What's next (20 sec):**
> "With more time, I'd add [feature 1] and [feature 2]. The system is designed to [future capability]."

### Demo Checklist
- [ ] Demo is 2 minutes or less
- [ ] Shows the live deployed system (not localhost)
- [ ] Uses real input and produces real output
- [ ] Audio is clear
- [ ] Uploaded to a shareable URL
- [ ] Link added to project README

## Artifact
Each participant: 2-minute demo video uploaded and linked in README.

## Weekend Complete
You walked in with an idea. You're walking out with a defined, designed, built, tested, deployed, and documented AI system. That's what shipping looks like.
