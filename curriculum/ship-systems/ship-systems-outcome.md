# Ship Systems Weekend — Outcome

## What You Built
A working AI system. Not a prototype. Not a slide deck. A system that is defined, designed, built, tested, deployed, and documented.

## Artifacts You Walk Away With

| Artifact | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| System Definition | Problem, user, inputs, outputs, success criteria | `docs/system-definition.md` |
| Architecture Spec | Components, data flow, agent roles, tool list | `docs/architecture-spec.md` |
| Working Codebase | Agent with implemented tools and core capability | `src/` |
| Eval Suite | Test cases, pass/fail criteria, automated checks | `tests/` |
| User Interface | CLI, web UI, or API endpoint | `src/` or `app/` |
| Live Deployment | System running on a public URL | Platform dashboard |
| Demo Video | 2-minute recorded demo of the live system | Linked in README |

## Skills You Demonstrated
- System definition: scoping a problem precisely enough to build against
- Architecture design: translating requirements into components
- Agent development: building and configuring AI agents with tools
- Evaluation: defining and automating quality criteria
- Interface design: making a system usable by others
- Deployment: shipping to production with environment configuration
- Communication: explaining what you built and why it matters

## What You Can Do Next
1. **Improve the system** — add more tools, handle more edge cases, improve output quality
2. **Add users** — share the URL, get feedback, iterate
3. **Add auth and persistence** — turn it from a demo into a product
4. **Build the next system** — you now have a repeatable process for going from idea to deployed AI system in 48 hours

## Your Proof of Work
- GitHub repository with full commit history
- Live URL
- Demo video
- Architecture documentation

This is portfolio-grade evidence that you can build and ship AI systems.
