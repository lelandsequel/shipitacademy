# Module 02: Define System

## Ship Systems Weekend — Saturday, 9:45 AM

---

## Objective
Each participant defines exactly what AI system they are building: the problem it solves, who uses it, what goes in, and what comes out. No ambiguity leaves this room.

## Duration
75 minutes

---

## Facilitator Guide

### Frame (10 min)
Most AI projects fail because the builder never defined what the system actually does. They start coding before they know what "done" looks like.

State the exercise:
> "You have 45 minutes to fill out the System Definition Template. When you're done, you'll read it to the room. If anyone is confused about what your system does, you rewrite it."

### Key questions every definition must answer:
1. **What problem does this system solve?** (One sentence. No compound sentences.)
2. **Who is the user?** (Specific. Not "anyone." A person with a name and a job.)
3. **What does the user give the system?** (Inputs: files, text, URLs, API calls — be specific)
4. **What does the system give back?** (Outputs: generated text, structured data, actions taken, files created)
5. **How do you know it worked?** (Success criteria: what does a correct output look like?)

### Build Block (45 min)
Participants work individually. Circulate. Push back on vague definitions:
- "It helps with marketing" — too vague. What specific marketing task? For whom?
- "It uses AI to analyze data" — what data? What analysis? What does the output look like?
- "It's like ChatGPT but for X" — what does it do that ChatGPT doesn't? What's the specific workflow?

### Review (20 min)
Each participant reads their definition aloud. 2 minutes each.
- Other participants ask one clarifying question
- Facilitator flags anything still ambiguous
- Participant revises on the spot if needed
