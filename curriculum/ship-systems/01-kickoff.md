# Module 01: Kickoff

## Ship Systems Weekend — Saturday, 9:00 AM

---

## Facilitator Guide

### Objective
Frame the goal. Set the standard. Make it real: every participant ships a working AI system by Sunday evening.

### Setup (before participants arrive)
- Room: power strips at every table, projector live, Wi-Fi credentials on whiteboard
- Confirm each participant has repo access, API keys, and dev environment ready
- Have the setup checklist printed as backup

### Opening (15 min)
1. Welcome. No preamble. State the mission:
   > "You are here to build and ship a working AI system in 48 hours. Not a demo. Not a slide deck. A system that runs, takes input, produces output, and is deployed to a live URL."
2. Introduce yourself. Briefly. Credentials only — no life story.
3. Introduce the weekend structure:
   - Saturday: define, design, scaffold, build
   - Sunday: eval, interface, deploy, demo

### Rules of Engagement (5 min)
- Ship over polish. Working beats elegant.
- Ask for help early. Getting stuck for 30 minutes without raising a hand is a failure mode.
- Every module produces an artifact. No module ends without something written, committed, or deployed.
- Phones away during build blocks. Slack/Discord is the only communication channel.

### Participant Introductions (20 min)
Each participant: 60 seconds max.
- Name
- What you build (day job or side project)
- What AI system you want to ship this weekend (even if rough)

Facilitator: take notes. You'll reference these during build support.

### Transition
> "Module 02 starts in 5 minutes. When we come back, you define exactly what you're building. Not vaguely. Precisely."

## Participant Handout

### What You're Doing This Weekend
You are building and shipping a working AI system. By Sunday evening, you will have:
- A defined system with clear inputs, outputs, and agent roles
- A working codebase with at least one end-to-end capability
- Evaluation criteria and test cases
- A deployed, live system with a URL
- A 2-minute recorded demo
